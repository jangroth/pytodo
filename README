A GTD extension for todo.txt (-> http://todotxt.com/), written in python. Hence the name :) 

Allows to use a new tag "+_" with single todos, which adds the following meaning:
+_yXX (+_y13) -> due in 2013
+_mXX (+_m09) -> due in September
+_wXX (+_w22) -> due in week 22
+_msd -> maybe some day
+_new -> not categorized yet

Parses a todo.txt file and displays a GTK indicator (which integrates into Unity) that displays all todos nicely 
sorted by upcoming due date and priority.
