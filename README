A GTD extension for todo.txt (-> http://todotxt.com/), written in python. Hence the name :)

Allows to use a new tag "+_" with single todos, which adds the following meaning:
+_yXX (+_y13) -> due in 2013
+_mXX (+_m09) -> due in September
+_wXX (+_w22) -> due in week 22
+_msd -> maybe some day

Code is pretty much in experimental beta stadium, but it scans an existing todo.txt file and sorts its entries by upcoming due-dates.
